This repo contains examples of agents built with different frameworks. This larger example is a business planning agent.

## Usage

Install dependencies:

```
pnpm install
```

(If you don't have `pnpm`, substituting `npm` for all these commands will work as well).

Then build

```
pnpm run build
```

Then you can run any of the examples like this

```
node dist/01-function-calling.js
```
