This repo contains examples of agents built with different frameworks.

## Usage

Install dependencies:

```
pnpm install
```

(If you don't have `pnpm`, substituting `npm` for all these commands will work as well).

Then build

```
pnpm run build
```

Then you can run any of the examples like this

```
node dist/01-function-calling.js
```

## Agent vs assistant

Note: depending on how pedantic you are feeling, some of these could technically be considered "assistants" instead of "agents". I am not sure how valuable this distinction is going to be, so for consistency I am just going to use the term "agent" everywhere.
